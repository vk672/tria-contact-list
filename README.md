## 🌍 Deployment

Deployed and auto-updated with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), linked to the project's GitHub repo for fast integration and CI/CD.

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- React (functional components, hooks)
- CSS (custom styles, modern gradient)
- Vercel (hosting)
- GitHub (version control, public repo)

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

- Used a gentle color gradient for visual impact.
- Avatar circles for contacts add personalization and polish.
- Form validation prevents incomplete data and guides user.
- Toast notifications provide instant, clear feedback.
- Mobile-first responsive layout for accessibility and usability.
- React modular structure for maintainability.

---

## 📋 Assumptions

- Data is kept in local state (no backend API).
- Phone validation accepts numeric, space, dash, and plus formats.
- No authentication; app resets on refresh as per assignment guidelines.
